# Data Reconciliation Tool

Our company had consistent data quality issues that were not addressed in a timely matter. Often this compromised various analysis done and models built.
  
The purpose of this tool was to ensure our data quality issues were easily identified and addressed in a regular manner. In particular, to ensure that the data is complete, consistent, accurate, unique, timely and valid.

Furthermore, it was necessary to produce a csv in a specific format in order to feed the checks done into our dashboards for visibility accross the company.


I have included a sample output to demonstrate what the tool is supposed to produce. Please note that the values in these outputs have been changed.
