# Project-Work
Personal projects done and various code samples I have written at work. While still relatively new, it is my hope to share the work and analysis I have done with those interested.
Most of the work would have both html and README.md outputs. For most of my projects I plan to keep the main outupt as html.
So if something looks odd when reading the README.md output, please refer to the html instead.
